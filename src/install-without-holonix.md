# Install Holochain without Holonix

In case you don't want to use Holonix to set up your development environment, here are steps provided to install Holochain binaries directly
from the crate registry. At first the required Rust toolchain and features are installed, followed by the actual Holochain dependencies.

> Holonix is the recommended way to set up your development environment.  
**We don't provide support for installing Holochain without Holonix.**
