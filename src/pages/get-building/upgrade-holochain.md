For existing hApps that have been written for Holochain version 0.1, these are steps to upgrade to Holochain version 0.2.

### Steps to upgrade Nix flake from Holochain version 0.1 to 0.2

!!! note
The following steps only apply to Nix flakes that have been either generated by the Holochain scaffolding tool
or follow the recommended format as described in [Dev Tools Setup](../install-advanced){target=_blank}.
!!!

In the root folder of the hApp to be upgraded execute the following command in a terminal:

```shell
nix run nixpkgs#gnused -- -i 's/dir=versions\/0_1/dir=versions\/0_2/g' flake.nix
```

Alternatively open `flake.nix` in an editor. It should look like this:

```nix
{
  description = "My hApp";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.follows = "holonix/nixpkgs";
    versions.url = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_1";
    holonix.url = "github:holochain/holochain";
    holonix.inputs.versions.follows = "versions";
  };
  ...
}
```

Change this line

```nix
versions.url = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_1";
```

to

```nix
versions.url = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_2";
```

### Nix flake for Holochain v0.2

The `flake.nix` for Holochain version 0.2 looks like this:

```nix
{
  description = "My hApp";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.follows = "holonix/nixpkgs";
    versions.url = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_2";
    holonix.url = "github:holochain/holochain";
    holonix.inputs.versions.follows = "versions";
  };
  ...
}
```

Before building the dev shell, **make sure to update the flake's input sources:**

```shell
nix flake update
```

Now you can build and execute the dev shell:

```shell
nix develop
```
