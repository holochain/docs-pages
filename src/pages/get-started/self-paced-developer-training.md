title: Self-Paced Developer Training
---

::: intro
This video curriculum is designed to support developers to design, develop, and deploy Holochain apps. By following along --- and supplementing your learning --- you can gain proficiency in clean, simple, and robust application development. You’ll also learn about best practices for dev environments when building on Holochain. We encourage you to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/DE9dtFXjZb), attend dev office hours (look for the next session date in the Announcements channel), and ask questions to get support from our team and thriving developer community.

!!! info A note on the video curriculum
This curriculum was developed over the course of our three Holochain Developer Trainings which were multi-day, cohort events. Those trainings were led by the co-founder of [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/), [Marcus Phillips](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusphillips/). We’ve edited the lecture portion of those videos down and included links to the course slides. Knowing some Rust will be very helpful so we’ve included some Rust resources below.
