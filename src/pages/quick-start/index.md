## Hardware Requirements

* 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended)
* 4+ cores CPU (6+ cores recommended)
* 30GB+ available disk space
* High Speed Internet connection

## Install the Holochain Dev Environment

!!! note Prerequisite for Windows: WSL2

The Nix package manager, which we use to install and manage Holochain development tools, only supports Mac and Linux. Please install Linux under Windows with [WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install){target=_blank}.

_Holochain is supported for the Ubuntu distribution under WSL2._
!!!

### Install the Nix Package Manager and set up Holochain binary cache

At a command line:

```bash
bash <(curl https://holochain.github.io/holochain/setup.sh)
```

### Verify installation

In a new shell session type:

```bash
nix run --refresh -j0 -v github:holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold -- --version
```

Look out for binaries being copied from `holochain-ci.cachix`. It proves that the Cachix binary
cache is configured correctly. If it works, there will be lines like this:

```text
downloading 'https://holochain-ci.cachix.org/nar/<some-hash>.nar.zst'...
```

The Holochain Dev Environment is configured successfully on your system if you see a scaffolding version like

```text
holochain_scaffolding_cli x.y.z
```

at the end of the output.

### Scaffold An Example Holochain App

Type the following at the command line:

```bash
nix run github:holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold -- example forum
```

When prompted, select the UI framework you prefer.

_After completing the project setup, the scaffolding tool will output the commands to run the Holochain app._
