!!! info Requires Holochain 0.3
The Holo hosting network runs the unstable Holochain 0.3 on all its nodes, so you'll need to make sure that your hApp is compatible with 0.3. The scaffolding tool commands in this guide will set up the proper dependencies for you. If you're starting with an existing hApp or have used the scaffolding tool commands in the [Get Started guide](/get-started/), you'll need to upgrade your hApp manually.
!!!

::: intro
This guide will help you build a Holo-enabled hApp from scratch or enable your existing hApp to be deployed on Holo.
:::

Holo is cloud hosting for Holochain. Holo helps you enable your users to experience your Holochain application with the simplicity of a web browser and without maintaining a node.

A core distinction versus running nodes on the traditional cloud is that Holo provides the key management and signing infrastructure for users' keys to be held client-side, so your users always have full agency.

We assume you're familiar with Holochain and have installed the pre-requisites from step 2 of the [Get Started guide](/get-started/).

There are two pathways in this section --- [**scaffolding a new hApp**](#get-started-from-scaffolding-tool) or [**migrating an existing hApp**](#migrate-from-a-pure-holochain-app). Both pathways contain largely the same information, so choose the one that best applies to your situation.

In both cases there are no required DNA changes for Holo Hosting --- only UI changes. However, Holo operates under a different context and we highly recommend that you read the [Holo core concepts](#holo-core-concepts-and-further-documentation), in particular the section on anonymous access, as this **will need DNA changes to enable certain features**.

## Get started from scaffolding tool

In this section we'll create a simple to-do app. Our commentary will focus on the UI differences compared to a pure Holochain context. If you need more information about creating a DNA, please refer to the [Holochain getting started guide](/get-started/3-forum-app-tutorial/).

### DNA {#scaffold-dna}

The Holochain scaffolding tool provides a `--holo` flag for scaffolding a hApp whose UI is compatible with both Holo hosting and pure Holochain environments. Additionally, because the Holo hosting infrastructure currently runs the unstable Holochain 0.3, you'll need to override the Holochain version that the scaffolding tool targets. Run the tool **with these flags** by typing in your terminal:

```shell
nix run --override-input versions 'github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/weekly'  github:holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold -- web-app --holo
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? App name (no whitespaces):
```
:::

Type your hApp's name using snake_case:

```text
super_todos
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Choose UI framework: ›
❯ Vue
  Svelte
  Lit
```
:::

Use the arrow keys to select a UI framework for your front-end and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. For this example choose `Vue`. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Do you want to set up the holonix development environment for this project? ›
❯ Yes (recommended)
  No
```
:::

Choose `Yes` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You should then see `Setting up nix development environment...` with some details of what is being added, followed by instructions of next steps for setting up the development environment for your hApp and continuing to scaffold more of its elements. Let's follow those instructions. First, enter the hApp project directory:

```shell
cd super_todos
```

Now enter the nix development shell (which makes all scaffolding tools as well as the Holochain binaries directly available from the command line) with:

```shell
nix develop
```

After it's finished downloading some packages, you should see:

::: output-block
```text
Holochain development shell spawned. Type exit to leave.
```
:::

Finally, install the `npm` dependencies with:

```shell
npm install
```

Now let's create a new DNA using the scaffolding tool, which is now directly available in the shell. Type:

```shell
hc scaffold dna
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? DNA name (snake_case):
```
:::

Many hApps have just one DNA, so in this case you can just type:

```text
todos
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
DNA "todos" scaffolded!
```
:::

DNAs are [composed of code modules](/concepts/2_application_architecture/), which we call zomes. A DNA should have at least two zomes, an *integrity zome* which declares the data structures and validation code, and a *coordinator zome* which contains, among other things, the API functions your UI will call to access your DNA.

Create your DNA's first pair of zomes with:

```shell
hc scaffold zome
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? What do you want to scaffold? ›
❯ Integrity/coordinator zome-pair (recommended)
  Only an integrity zome
  Only a coordinator zome
```
:::

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select `Integrity/coordinator zome-pair`. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Enter coordinator zome name (snake_case):
 (The integrity zome will automatically be named '{name of coordinator zome}_integrity')
```
:::

Type in a name for the zome. In this case you can just use the same name as the DNA, `todos`. You should then see:

```shell
? Scaffold integrity zome in folder "dnas/todos/zomes/integrity/"? (y/n) ›
```

Press <kbd>Y</kbd> (this option is for advanced users who may have set up a different folder structure). You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
Integrity zome "todo_integrity" scaffolded!
? Scaffold coordinator zome in "dnas/todos/zomes/coordinator/"? (y/n) ›
```
:::

Press <kbd>Y</kbd> again.

You will then see `Coordinator zome "todos" scaffolded!` along with output from the initial downloading and setting up of the Holochain Rust HDK, followed by instructions for adding your first entry type.

Now we get to the really exciting part! In the next steps you will specify your data model, and the scaffolding tool will automatically add both zome and UI code to your hApp.

In this to-do hApp, every to-do item is stored as an [entry](/resources/glossary/#entry). Add a new entry definition with:

```shell
  hc scaffold entry-type
```

You should see:

```shell
✔ Entry type name (snake_case): ·
```

Enter the name:

```text
todo_item
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
Which fields should the entry contain?

? Choose field type: ›
❯ String
  bool
  u32
  i32
  f32
  Timestamp
  ActionHash
  EntryHash
  AgentPubKey
  Option of...
  Vector of...
```
:::

For this example, you will just have a text field describing the to-do item. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select `String`.

You should see:

::: output-block
```text
? Field name: ›
```
:::

Enter the name `description`. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Should this field be visible in the UI? (y/n) ›
```
:::

Press <kbd>Y</kbd>. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Choose widget to render this field: ›
❯ TextArea
  TextField
```
:::

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to choose a `TextArea` because you want multi-line to-dos. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Add another field to the entry? (y/n) ›
```
:::

Press <kbd>N</kbd>. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Which CRUD functions should be scaffolded (SPACE to select/unselect, ENTER to continue)? ›
✔ Update
✔ Delete
```
:::

The scaffolding tool can add coordinator zome functions and front-end code for updating and deleting entries. In the case of our to-do app we want to be able to do both, which is the default, so just press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Should a link from the original entry be created when this entry is updated? ›
❯ Yes (more storage cost but better read performance, recommended)
  No (less storage cost but worse read performance)
```
:::

Because Holochain stores data in append-only [source chains](/concepts/3_source_chain/), updating requires choosing a strategy of how to find updated data. The scaffolding tool allows you to choose between two strategies, one where updates are only linked to the _previous_ version, and one where an extra link is also added to the _original_ entry for each update. For this use case either strategy would work fine, so press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to choose the default. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
Entry type "todo_item" scaffolded!
```
:::

The final step is create a collection that can be used to retrieve all of the to-do items that users create. To create a collection, type:

```shell
hc scaffold collection
```

You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
Collection name (snake_case, eg. "all_posts"): ›
```
:::

Enter `todos_by_author` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Which type of collection should be scaffolded? ›
❯ Global (get all entries of the selected entry types)
  By author (get entries of the selected entry types that a given author has created)
```
:::

Use the arrow key to select `By author` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
? Which entry type should be collected? ›
❯ TodoItem
```
:::

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should then see:

::: output-block
```text
Collection "todos_by_author" scaffolded!
```
:::

### UI {#scaffold-ui}

The biggest difference between a Holo application and a pure Holochain application is in the UI. The scaffolding tool should automatically have generated everything required here, so we'll simply point out the primary differences, which will all be in `ui/src/App.vue`.

Open up this file in your favorite text editor now and follow along!

In a Holo setting we use the [`@holo-host/web-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holo-host/web-sdk) library instead of `@holochain/client`. Web SDK provides its own implementation of `AppAgentWebsocket`, which is almost the same as the one provided by `@holochain/client`. Scroll down to the beginning of the `<script lang="ts">` section and you can see where these modules are imported:

```typescript
import WebSdk from '@holo-host/web-sdk';
import type { AgentState } from '@holo-host/web-sdk';
```

Just below this, you can see that this Vue component's state has an `IS_HOLO` property, which is set by looking for an environment variable:

```typescript
export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    // Add your subcomponents here
  },
  data(): {
    client: AppAgentClient | undefined;
    loading: boolean;
    IS_HOLO: boolean;
  } {
    return {
      client: undefined,
      loading: true,
      IS_HOLO: ['true', '1', 't'].includes(import.meta.env.VITE_APP_IS_HOLO?.toLowerCase()),
    };
  },
```

Later on, the component looks for this property and tries to connect to a Holo hosting device via the Web SDK. In addition to handling connections, the Web SDK also provides an authentication form for users to generate in-browser keys and install [cells](/resources/glossary/#cell) on the network. This form is customizable --- here we set the name of the app.

```typescript
  async mounted() {
    if (this.IS_HOLO) {
      const client: WebSdk = await WebSdk.connect({
        chaperoneUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL,
        authFormCustomization: {
          appName: 'super_todos',
        }
      });
```

Now we handle connection state changes --- the `WebSdk` client can be either connected to a host or disconnected, and once it's connected, it can either be logged in or anonymous. The default scaffolded UI shows a loading spinner until the user is logged in; you may want to change this to show some UI for anonymous users. (Read more about anonymous users in the [Holo core concepts](#holo-core-concepts-and-further-documentation) below.)

```typescript
      client.on('agent-state', (agent_state: AgentState) => {
        this.loading = !agent_state.isAvailable || agent_state.isAnonymous
      });
```

Now we show the login/signup form. If you wanted to show some UI to anonymous users, you might want to call `client.signUp({ cancellable: true })` when a 'log in' button is pressed.

```typescript
      client.signUp({ cancellable: false });

      this.client = client
```

Finally, if we're not in a Holo context, just use the standard Holochain client.

```typescript
    } else {
      // We pass '' as url because it will dynamically be replaced in launcher
      // environments.
      this.client = await AppAgentWebsocket.connect(new URL('https://UNUSED'), 'super_todos');
      this.loading = false;
    }
```

Because there is a concept of 'logging in', we also need a 'log out' option to clear user keys from the client. In the UI:

```html
<mwc-button
  v-if="IS_HOLO"
  style="margin-top: 16px"
  raised
  label="Logout"
  @click="logout"
/>
```

And in the script (note again that, because we don't want to show any UI to anonymous users, we show them the login form immediately after logging out):

```typescript
    async logout () {
      await (this.client as WebSdk).signOut();
      await (this.client as WebSdk).signIn({ cancellable: false });
    }
```

### Testing

Holo provides the `holo-dev-server` binary, which simulates the Holo network locally for development. `holo-dev-server` spins up a Holochain conductor, along with a local instance of the Chaperone service, which delivers a JavaScript file that connects the browser to the Holo network. Like the real Holo network, `holo-dev-server` uses `.happ` bundles, which do not include a UI. (The `hc` developer tool creates both a `.happ` bundle and a `.webhapp` bundle in the `workdir/` folder for you.) When you scaffold an app with the `--holo` flag, its dev environment will provide `holo-dev-server` on the command line for you.

1. Ensure you're in the nix development environment by checking the shell prompt. Run `nix develop` in the root of your project's folder if you aren't.
2. Run `npm run start:holo`, which:
    1. Starts `holo-dev-server` and provisions instances (cells) of your DNA for two agents,
    2. Automatically opens an instance of a cell and network inspector called [Holochain Playground](https://github.com/darksoil-studio/holochain-playground) in your browser, and
    3. Runs a local dev web server for the UI called [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
3. Access your two agents' UIs in your browser at `http://localhost:8888` and `http://localhost:8889`.

The windows should not be very exciting yet, because you haven't edited the hApp to use the generated UI elements, but what you see on the screen should be some hints on how to proceed.

So let's follow those hints. Switch to a code editor for these steps:

1. Open the Vue file `ui/src/App.vue` and add two imports near the top, just below `<script lang="ts">`:

    ```typescript
    import MyTodos from './todos/todos/MyTodos.vue';
    import CreateTodoItem from './todos/todos/CreateTodoItem.vue';
    ```

2. Replace the "EDIT ME" text further down with:

    ```html
    <CreateTodoItem></CreateTodoItem>
    <MyTodos author={client.myPubKey}></MyTodos>
    ```

Save the file, and you should see that the windows have auto-updated to show something that should look like this:

![Two web browser windows showing basic widgets to manipulate the shared to-do list](/assets/img/enable-holo/scaffolded-todos.png)

You now have a fully functional Holo app up and running!

## Migrate from a pure Holochain app

Only minor UI changes are technically required for Holo hosting. However, Holo operates under a different set of assumptions and we highly recommend that you read the [Holo core concepts](#holo-core-concepts-and-further-documentation) section of this guide. It is likely that you will want to reconsider certain UX flows.

This example will use an example forum hApp with a Vue-based UI, but feel free to follow along with your own hApp instead. Remember that your hApp needs to target Holochain 0.3 in order to run on the Holo network. <!-- [FIXME -- UPDATE THIS TEXT], so you might need to follow the [0.1 → 0.2 migration guide](/get-started/upgrade-holochain/) first -->

```shell
nix run --override-input versions 'github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/weekly' github:holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold -- example forum
```

### UI {#migrate-ui}

In the forum hApp, the relevant UI code is in `App.vue`. In your hApp, it'll likely be where you initialize your `AppWebsocket` client.

In a Holo setting we use [`@holo-host/web-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holo-host/web-sdk) which provides an instance of `WebSdk`. This object has a `.connect()` method just like `AppAgentWebsocket` from `@holochain/client`.

You'll first need to add Web SDK to your UI project:

```shell
cd ui
```
```shell
npm install @holo-host/web-sdk
```

And import it into your `App.vue` file:

```typescript
import WebSdk from '@holo-host/web-sdk';
```

If you're updating your hApp from Holochain 0.1, which uses `@holochain/client` 0.12, check to make sure that the component's `client` data property is typed to `AppAgentClient`:

```typescript
export default defineComponent({
  components: {
    //...
  },
  data(): {
    client: AppAgentClient | undefined; // Ensure that client is not AppAgentWebsocket
    //...
  } {
    // ...
  }
```

You can then initialize a client for both self-hosted Holochain and Holo-hosted users, assuming you want your UI to be compatible with both. Edit the body of the `data()` function above to check for a `VITE_APP_IS_HOLO` environment variable that you'll pass at build time:

```typescript
  data(): {
    client: AppAgentClient | undefined;
    loading: boolean;
    IS_HOLO: boolean;
  } {
    return {
      client: undefined,
      loading: true,
      IS_HOLO: ['true', '1', 't'].includes(import.meta.env.VITE_APP_IS_HOLO?.toLowerCase()),
    };
  },
```

The Web SDK client loads and connects to an iframe called Chaperone. Chaperone is a key and connection manager for the Holo network and is invisible to the user unless they're signing up or logging in. Let's initialize this client in the Vue `mounted()` lifecycle hook.

Because the Holo network acts like a remote conductor, you'll need to handle connectivity issues. Changes to the connection are emitted as events, and you can register an event handler. You can see the full list of emitted events in the [Web SDK documentation](https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk).

```typescript
  async mounted() {
    if (this.IS_HOLO) {
      const client: WebSdk = await WebSdk.connect({
        // The following will be passed as an environment variable at runtime or
        // build time; we'll explain this in the testing section.
        chaperoneUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL,
        authFormCustomization: {
          // Display name on the sign-up/login form. You can also set it in
          // Cloud Console when deploying, which overrides this value.
          appName: 'forum-app',
        }
      });

      // Register an event handler for connection status changes.
      client.on('agent-state', (agent_state: AgentState) => {
        this.loading = !agent_state.isAvailable
      });

      this.client = client
    } else {
      this.client = await AppAgentWebsocket.connect('', 'forum');
      this.loading = false;
    }
}
```

Now your UI can connect to the Holo network and read forum posts. However, before they log in, users can't post or comment yet because they don't yet have a source chain. They are considered "anonymous" and can only request public data from the network.

!!! note
Unlike in pure Holochain, you **cannot assume that a user has provided their keys** when the connection is established, because Holo hosting allows anonymous access to hApp data that's meant to be seen publicly, such as forum posts. This may require changes to your application logic. Read more about how to implement this feature in the [Holo core concepts](#holo-core-concepts-and-further-documentation) section of this guide.
!!!

Holo uses "sign-up" and "sign-in" terminology but there is no external authentication process. In both processes Chaperone derives a key pair for the user from the email and password they enter, with sign-up also triggering the provisioning of new hApp cells on a hosting device in the Holo network.

So let's add sign-up and sign-in functionality to the app. Again, in the forum example the relevant code is in `App.vue`.

```html
<main>
  <h1>Forum</h1>
  <!-- Add these buttons -->
  <div v-if="IS_HOLO && !isLoggedIn">
    <mwc-button
      style="margin-top: 16px"
      raised
      label="Sign Up"
      @click="signUp"
    />

    <mwc-button
      style="margin-top: 16px"
      raised
      label="Sign In"
      @click="signIn"
    />
  </div>
  <!-- End of changes -->

  <div id="content">
    <h2>All Posts</h2>
    <AllPosts></AllPosts>
    <span style="margin-bottom: 16px"></span>
    <CreatePost></CreatePost>
  </div>
</main>
```

```typescript
// If you haven't already added any methods to App.vue, you may need to create
// this object -- it goes in the object you pass to `defineComponent`.
  methods: {
    // ...
    async signUp () {
      await (this.client as WebSdk).signUp({ cancellable: true });
    },

    async signIn () {
      await (this.client as WebSdk).signIn({ cancellable: true });
    },

    // ...
  }
```

These trigger the display of a full-screen credentials modal dialog from the Chaperone iframe, defaulting to either a sign-up or sign-in form. The user can also toggle between them directly.

![An example of the Chaperone sign-up/sign-in modal form](/assets/img/enable-holo/signup-signin-modal.png)

During sign-up, a registration code field can be shown to enable [**membrane proof**](/resources/glossary/#membrane-proof) workflows. This field allows the user to submit some sort of joining code on signup. Read more about membrane proofs in the [Holo core concepts](#implementing-read-only-cells) section of this guide.

Finally, we will also need sign-out functionality to clear user keys from local browser storage. In the markup section:

```html
  <!-- Add this button just below the two buttons you previously added. -->
  <div v-else>
    <mwc-button
      style="margin-top: 16px"
      raised
      label="Sign Out"
      @click="signOut"
    />
  </div>
```

And in the script section:

```typescript
  methods: {
    // ...
    async signOut () {
      await (this.client as WebSdk).signOut());
    },

    // ...
  }
```

Now you're ready to build and test!

### Building and testing

Holo provides the `holo-dev-server` binary, which simulates the Holo network locally for development. `holo-dev-server` serves a copy of Chaperone, the JavaScript library that connects the browser to the Holo network and manages user keys, and runs a Holochain conductor. Like the real Holo network, `holo-dev-server` uses `.happ` bundles, which do not include a UI. (The `hc` developer tool creates both a `.happ` bundle and a `.webhapp` bundle for you.)

To include `holo-dev-server` in your development environment, update your project's `flake.nix` file to match the below, and re-enter the shell:

```nix
{
  description = "Template for Holochain app development";

  inputs = {
    // Change this line -- holo-dev-server isn't available in the 0_1 and 0_2
    // channels.
    versions.url = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/weekly";
    holochain-flake.url = "github:holochain/holochain";
    // If you're updating from Holochain 0.2, this line may need to be changed.
    holochain-flake.inputs.versions.follows = "versions";

    nixpkgs.follows = "holochain-flake/nixpkgs";
    flake-parts.follows = "holochain-flake/flake-parts";
  };

  // Add `hds-releases` to the following list.
  outputs = inputs @ { flake-parts, holochain-flake, hds-releases, ... }:
    flake-parts.lib.mkFlake {
      inherit inputs;
    }
    {
      systems = builtins.attrNames inputs.holochain-flake.devShells;
      perSystem =
        { config
        , pkgs
        , system
        , ...
        }: {
          devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
            inputsFrom = [ holochain-flake.devShells.${system}.holonix ];
            // Add an element in this list to import the Holo dev server binary package.
            packages = [ pkgs.nodejs_20, hds-releases.packages.holo-dev-server-bin ];
          };
        };
    };
}
```

To connect your application to `holo-dev-server`, point the client's `chaperoneUrl` to `https://localhost:24274`. The easiest way to do this is to supply an environment variable that you can then look for in your UI:

```typescript
const client: WebSdk = await WebSdk.connect({
  // We'll explain this in the testing section.
  chaperoneUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL,
  authFormCustomization: {
    // Display name on the credentials form.
    // You can also set it in Cloud Console when deploying.
    appName: 'forum-app',
  }
});
```

Let's add some build, run, and test scripts to your project's `package.json` file. You should already have scripts to build a `.hApp` file, like below.

```json
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "build:happ": "npm run build:zomes && hc app pack workdir --recursive",
    "build:zomes": "RUSTFLAGS='' CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown",
    // ...
  },
```

Let's add the following scripts to the top of the `"scripts"` object. These will:

1. Build your `.happ` file,
2. Run `holo-dev-server` with your `.happ` file and make it available on port `24274` (make sure you change `workdir/forum.happ` to match your hApp),
3. Serve the `holochain-playground` UI at `localhost:4444` and open it in a browser, and
4. Start two agents and open their UIs in the browser, pointing them both to the local URL that `holo-dev-server` is running on.

Take note of the `"network:holo"` script; it's what passes the `VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL` and `VITE_APP_IS_HOLO` environment variables to your UI so that it knows to connect to Holo, and specifically to a local `holo_dev_server`.

```json
    "start:holo": "AGENTS=2 BOOTSTRAP_PORT=$(port) SIGNAL_PORT=$(port) npm run network:holo",
    "network:holo": "npm run build:happ && UI_PORT=$(port) concurrently \"npm run launch:holo-dev-server\" \"holochain-playground ws://localhost:4444\" \"concurrently-repeat 'VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL=http://localhost:24274 VITE_APP_IS_HOLO=true npm start -w ui' $AGENTS\"",
    "launch:holo-dev-server": "holo-dev-server workdir/forum.happ",
```

These scripts assume that you have a `start` script set up in a `ui` workspace that serves your UI at a local URL, which you should have if you created the hApp using our scaffolding tool.

You now have a fully functional Holo app up and running!

!!! info
When you build your UI for production, make sure that the `VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL` environment variable is set to `https://chaperone.holo.hosting`.
!!!

## Deploy

This process assumes you already have a Cloud Console account. If you do not, you can sign up at https://register.holo.host

### Deploy a UI

Holo does not currently offer UI hosting. hApp managers will need to deploy their UI separately for now.

!!! info
Holo supports "headless hosting" where there is no Holo-enabled UI. In this case Holo will maintain copies of the [DHT](/resources/glossary/#distributed-hash-table-dht), but will not hold any source chains. Holo hosting requires a special [membrane proof](#implementing-read-only-cells) for read-only host agents in order to make this work.

Holo does not support direct programmatic/API access to deployed hApps.
!!!

### Deploy a hApp to the Holo network

1. Log into Cloud Console.
2. Click on "Add a hApp".
3. Fill out hApp details:
    * "Link to hApp file" must point to a publicly accessible `.happ` file.
    * (Optional) "URL of hosted UI" is the URL which your users will access your UI from.
    * (Optional) Configuration of memproof/registration code.
4. Click "Deploy".
5. Wait for deployment to take effect. It may take up to 30 minutes.

## Holo core concepts and further documentation

Holochain assumes that agents are in control of their own conductor, meaning:

* Agent key pairs are located on the same machine as their data and hApp instance, which is typically a computer they own.
* Agents can choose which hApps / DNAs are co-located on the same conductor.
* All hApps running on a conductor belong to a single user who may have multiple keys.
* The client and conductor are located on the same machine.
* Agents have access to the conductor's [admin API WebSocket](https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html).

These assumptions are not true for Holo, and this has architectural implications for hApp development.

### Holo architecture

![The Holo hosting network. A typical HoloPort hosting device sits at the middle, bridging a peer-to-peer network of Holochain app participants (including other Holo hosting devices) to a user's web browser via an intermediary infrastructure consisting of a matchmaking service, a user-to-host resolver service, a traffic proxy, and a privileged iframe containing Chaperone in the user's browser.](/assets/img/enable-holo/holo-hosting-infrastructure.png)

The diagram above shows the interconnections between different parts of the Holo network. In particular, note that:

* Keys are on the client, and conductor is on the host.
* A user has no guarantee that any two hApps hosted for them will share the same conductor.
* Multiple users may share the same conductor.

### Client-conductor separation

In Holo hosting, the client and conductor are assumed to be both physically distinct and under the control of different agents. To enable and support this, Holo provides an alternative to the [`@holochain/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client) library in the form of [`@holo-host/web-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holo-host/web-sdk).

Both the Holo Web SDK and `@holochain/client` provide implementations of `AppAgentClient`, which allows a user to connect to their cells in a conductor (whether those cells live on their own device or a Holo hosting device), and therefore have a mostly unified interface. However, Web SDK instantiates a secure iframe within the UI called Chaperone, which serves as a key signer and connection manager. Chaperone derives keys for users and handles all Holochain signing requests in the Holo context, without sending any key material back to the Holo network.

To use the Web SDK, import and instantiate it wherever you would normally import and instantiate `@holochain/client`. If you want your UI to support both self-hosted Holochain and Holo-hosted users, you can import both the WebSDK and `@holochain/client` and instantiate a client as necessary based on the presence of an environment variable passed in at build time (as an example, a UI generated by the scaffolding tool uses `VITE_APP_IS_HOLO`; see [code samples above](#scaffold-ui)).

```typescript
Import { AppAgentWebsocket, AppAgentClient } from '@holochain/client';
import WebSdk from '@holo-host/web-sdk';

// You will want a way for your UI build tool to flag Holo vs Holochain client
// instantiation. Many front-end build tools allow you to pass environment
// variables which are then made available to your UI code's JavaScript.
// The Vite dev server, for instance, makes them available in a global object
// called `import.meta.env`.
const client: AppAgentClient = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_IS_HOLO
  ? await WebSdk.connect({
    // Here we use this same environment variable technique to pass the local
    // holo-dev-server's URL during local testing.
    chaperoneUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_CHAPERONE_URL || 'https://chaperone.holo.hosting',
    authFormCustomization: {
      appName: 'example-happ',
    }
  })
  : await AppAgentWebsocket.connect({
    new URL('https://UNUSED'),
    'example_happ'
  });
```

WebSDK documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk#holo-hosting-web-sdk).

#### Sign-up, sign-in, sign-out

Users derive application-specific keys directly in Chaperone using their email and password. This is done directly in the iframe provided by the Chaperone connection manager, which the application developer can customize and must invoke somewhere in their user flow:

```typescript
client.signUp();
client.signIn();
```

Holo decides whether to show a sign-up or log-in form based on whether a user has already had an instance of the hApp provisioned for them on a hosting device in the network.

In Holo, `AdminWebsocket` functionality is handled completely by Envoy, a service running on Holo hosts that handles the provisioning of hApps. That means that, just like with the [Holochain Launcher](https://github.com/holochain/launcher), the admin API isn't available to UIs. Some application API endpoints, such as `client.agent_info()`, are also not available before the user has signed in.

Users should also have a means of clearing their keys from local storage using:

```typescript
client.signOut();
```

#### Handling connection state

Since the host conductor is remote and a connection to it isn't guaranteed, UIs need to handle different connection states appropriately. In addition to the `'signal'` event, Chaperone makes connection state information available to the client via the `'agent-state'` event that the UI can listen for and handle. Example:

```typescript
client.on('agent-state', (agent_state: AgentState) => {
  if (!agent_state.isAvailable) {
    if (agent_state.unrecoverableError) {
      // Show a dialog with the error message.
    } else {
      // Show some sort of disconnected/reconnecting status.
    }
  } else if (agent_state.isAnonymous) {
    // Modify the UI to hide things that should only be accessible to logged-in
    // users.
  }
});
```

!!! info A note on conductor API WebSocket access
Due to the security implications of multi-tenant conductors, `AdminWebsocket` (and some `AppWebsocket`) functionality is not directly exposed to Holo clients. Instead, this functionality is exposed indirectly via Holo Web SDK methods where appropriate.
!!!

### hApp paradigm

As with self-hosted Holochain, hApps are the fundamental unit within Holo. But unlike self-hosted Holochain, a user's hApps aren't guaranteed to all exist on the same machine. This means:

* All cells for a hApp are guaranteed to be co-located on the same Holo host.
* Cloned cells are treated as part of their parent hApp bundle and are thus also co-located with the other cells in the hApp.
* hApps are deployed onto the Holo network by an agent of the Cloud Console app, who is the designated manager for the hApp.
* hApp managers are responsible for deploying application updates and paying host invoices.

#### Multi-tenant conductor

Holo makes use of multi-tenant conductors to provide functionality typically expected of traditional web applications. Each conductor runs application instances belonging to multiple users.

If the application allows it, Holo will run **read-only cells** of deployed applications **under each host's agent** in addition to any user cells. These cells serve two purposes:

* **Providing high-uptime nodes**: These nodes will send and receive gossip to sustain the network as long as hosts are online. They also ensure that when users connect to their host they already have the latest data available, since Holochain maintains a single local copy of a DHT for all cells of that DNA.
* **Serving data to anonymous users**: For some use cases, it's not desirable to require users to create an account, for example, reading an article. Where developers make these use cases available to their users, the data is retrieved by a read-only cell.

This behavior isn't available by default; you'll have to implement functionality to both give anonymous users access to read-only functions and prevent them from making writes. This is described in the next section.

### Implementing read-only cells

In order to provide high-uptime nodes and anonymous hosted user access via read-only cells while keeping your hApp safe from defacement, you'll need to restrict what a read-only cell can do. A read-only cell is **read-only by convention**; that is, it's only because you're checking whether the cell has been provisioned for a real user or as a read-only cell.

The most secure way to restrict access to a hApp's data is with [**membrane proofs**](/resources/glossary/#membrane-proof). A membrane proof is supplied at installation time and acts like an ID card, allowing the hApp to admit valid members only. However, this prevents Holo hosting devices from provisioning read-only cells unless explicit affordances are made.

Hosting devices instantiate read-only cells using a zero-byte membrane proof. (Note: Holochain makes a distinction between _no_ membrane proof and an _empty_, zero-byte membrane proof using Rust's `Option<>` type.)

However, a secure membrane proof should be either hard to guess or bound exclusively to the user's public key. A zero-byte membrane proof is neither, which essentially means that anyone can join your application and read its data. But it does mean you can enforce write restrictions on agents that have joined using a zero-byte membrane proof. **Make sure this is appropriate for your users' security and privacy** before implementing the following pattern!

To implement logic to allow read-only cells to join a DNA's network but not write data, your integrity zome's validation function should check the author's membrane proof, then allow them to join the network but reject [CRUD](/resources/glossary/#create-read-update-delete-crud) operations if the proof is zero bytes. The following code shows an example of how to do both of these things.

```rust
/// A helper function to check whether a membrane proof is from a special Holo-
/// hosted read-only agent.
fn is_read_only_membrane_proof(membrane_proof: &Option<MembraneProof>) -> bool {
    match membrane_proof {
        // A membrane proof can either be:
        //
        // 1. some app-specific bytes,
        // 2. zero bytes (Holo read-only instance), or
        // 3. `None` (no membrane proof supplied)
        //
        // In this example, we're treating 2 and 3 the same.
        // In your app, you may want to treat 3 differently.
        Some(p) => p.bytes() == &[0],
        None => true
    }
}

/// A helper function to validate a membrane proof. You can use this in both
/// your `genesis_self_check` and `validate` functions.
fn validate_membrane_proof(membrane_proof: &Option<MembraneProof>) -> ExternResult<ValidateCallbackResult> {
    // Read-only membrane proofs are always permitted.
    if is_read_only_membrane_proof(membrane_proof) {
        return Ok(ValidateCallbackResult::Valid);
    }

    // Your custom membrane proof validation should go here.
}

/// A helper function to check whether a CRUD op should be allowed. In the
/// sample `validate` function, it's used for both entry and link CRUD actions.
/// Note that this DOES NOT implement all the write permissions your app may
/// need; it only implements this simple logic:
///
/// * Read-only cells may only write system actions, plus CRUD actions within
///   the `init()` callback.
/// * All other cells may write anything they wish.
fn has_permission_to_write(op: &Op) -> Result<bool, WasmError> {
    let action_type = op.action_type();

    // All non-CRUD actions should be allowed.
    if let ActionType::Dna | ActionType::AgentValidationPkg | ActionType::InitZomesComplete | ActionType::OpenChain | ActionType::CloseChain = action_type {
        return Ok(true);
    }

    // In general, all CRUD actions for a read-only node should be invalid.
    // The only ones that _must_ be valid are actions that create (but don't
    // update) special system entries:
    //
    // * `AgentPubKey`
    // * `CapGrant`
    // * `CapClaim` (optional)
    //
    // When allowing cap grants, we're unable to check whether the grant should
    // be allowed -- that has to happen in the coordinator zome.
    if let ActionType::Create = action_type {
        match op.entry_data().map(|d| d.1) {
            Some(EntryType::AgentPubKey | EntryType::CapClaim | EntryType::CapGrant) => {
                return Ok(true);
            },
            Some(_) => { },
            None => {
                // This should be an impossible condition, as an op produced
                // from a `Create` action should always know its entry type.
                unreachable!("Undefined behavior; entry type missing from Create action");
            }
        }
    }

    // Your app may also want to allow certain CRUD actions for public or
    // private app data, such as anonymous page view counters for blog posts, or
    // updates/deletes on system actions. Keep in mind the risk of anonymous
    // spamming though!

    // We don't always look at the membrane proof, because that would cause too
    // much network traffic and processing as source chains grew larger.
    // Instead, we use 'inductive' validation, in which we assume that, if
    // there's a prior CRUD action on the chain and another validator has marked
    // it as valid, it's because that validator has also applied these same
    // rules. A sequence of such checks eventually leads back to a check on the
    // membrane proof.

    // Walk back through the source chain until we find something interesting --
    // either a CRUD action or a membrane proof.
    let mut prior_action_hash = op.prev_action().map(|h| h.clone());

    // Most read-only apps will want to do a few writes to set up state at app
    // initialization time. These writes happen in each zome's `init` function,
    // if defined, and if all inits succeed, an `InitZomesComplete` action is
    // written to the chain. So we need to keep track of whether the op
    // currently being validated comes before or after that point.
    let mut init_zomes_complete_found = false;

    while let Some(ref hash) = prior_action_hash {
        let record = must_get_valid_record(hash.clone())?;

#### Anonymous zome function access

Every function call to a coordinator zome must be signed, and a call will only be successful if a [capability grant](/resources/glossary/#capability-grant) has been issued for it. Capability grants can be unrestricted, or they can be restricted to a particular token or public key.

Normally, when a Holo agent is logged in, or the user is running the hApp on their own machine, the key pair used to sign function calls is the same as the key pair used to author data in the cell. This is called the [author grant](/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#author-grant), and it's automatically privileged to call every function. For an anonymous agent accessing a read-only instance, however, this is not true. For them to be able to make a function call, you need to also create an unrestricted capability grant for that function.

```rust
fn set_read_only_cap_tokens() -> ExternResult<()> {
    let mut fn = BTreeSet::new();
    // Grant unrestricted anonymous access to the two article getter functions.
    fns.insert((zome_info()?.name, "get_article".into()));
    fns.insert((zome_info()?.name, "get_all_articles".into()));

    let functions = GrantedFunctions::Listed(fns);
    create_cap_grant(CapGrantEntry {
        tag: "read-only anonymous access".into(),
        access: CapAccess::Unrestricted,
        functions,
    })?;
    Ok(())
}

#[hdk_extern]
fn init(_: ()) -> ExternResult<InitCallbackResult> {
    set_read_only_cap_tokens()?;

    Ok(InitCallbackResult::Pass)
}
```

In general, you should not list functions in the above grant that write new capability grants to the read-only instance's chain, to prevent an attacker from expanding their privileges. And depending on your app, it's probably also good practice to limit access to functions that don't write to the source chain but can still be disruptive, such as [calling other cells' APIs](/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/) or [sending signals to other cells](/concepts/9_signals/).

Note that these protections implemented in a coordinator zome also do not prevent reads by people who run the hApp on their own devices and supply a zero-byte membrane proof. When you implement the read-only pattern, you're **making a conscious choice to make the DHT public** for reading while restricting who can write to it.
