title: Holochain Upgrade 0.4 â†’ 0.5
---

::: intro
For existing hApps that are currently using Holochain 0.4, here's the guide to get you upgraded to 0.5.

The biggest change in Holochain 0.5 is kitsune2, a new wire protocol implementation promises better gossip performance. Kitsune2 is incompatible with the wire protocols used in Holochain 0.4 and prior, so conductors running 0.5 won't be able to communicate with conductors running earlier releases.
:::

## Quick instructions

To upgrade your hApp written for Holochain 0.5, follow these steps:

1. Update your `flake.nix` to use the 0.5 version of Holochain. This involves changing the version numbers of two packages. {#update-nix-flake}

    !!! info Your `flake.nix` might look different
    Depending on the age of your project, **you might need to make extra changes** to make it look like the one below. If you're upgrading a project that was created for Holochain 0.3 or earlier, use the 'Copy' button on the diff below and replace the contents of your `flake.nix` with the copied text.
    !!!

    ```diff
     {
       description = "Flake for Holochain app development";
       inputs = {
    -    holonix.url = "github:holochain/holonix?ref=main-0.4";
    +    holonix.url = "github:holochain/holonix?ref=main-0.5";
         nixpkgs.follows = "holonix/nixpkgs";
         flake-parts.follows = "holonix/flake-parts";
    -    playground.url = "github:darksoil-studio/holochain-playground?ref=main-0.4";
       };
       outputs = inputs@{ flake-parts, ... }: flake-parts.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } {
         systems = builtins.attrNames inputs.holonix.devShells;
         perSystem = { inputs', pkgs, ... }: {
           formatter = pkgs.nixpkgs-fmt;
           devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
             inputsFrom = [ inputs'.holonix.devShells.default ];
             packages = (with pkgs; [
               nodejs_20
               binaryen
    -          inputs'.playground.packages.hc-playground
             ]);
             shellHook = ''
               export PS1='\[\033[1;34m\][holonix:\w]\$\[\033[0m\] '
             '';
           };
         };
       };
     }
    ```

    Don't worry if you don't have the `hc-playground` lines in your flake. This was added after the first release of 0.4, so you can safely ignore it if you don't have it. It is now included in Holonix by default, so it will be available when you next open a Nix shell.

    This will take effect later when you enter a new Nix shell. It's important to update your Nix flake lockfile at this point, to ensure you benefit from the cache we provide:

    ```shell
    nix flake update && git add flake.* && nix develop
    ```
2. Update your root `package.json` file with the new package versions, along with a change to accommodate Playground being bundled with Holonix and the local network services being [supplied by a new binary](#hc-run-local-services-replaced-with-kitsune2-bootstrap-srv): {#update-package-json}

             "template": "svelte" // This might be different for your app
         }
     }
    ```
3. Update your project's package dependencies ([see below](#update-your-package-dependencies)).
4. Follow the [breaking change update instructions](#update-your-application-code) below to get your code working again.
5. Try running your tests:

    ```shell
    npm test
    ```

    and starting the application:

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```
6. Be aware of some changes that won't break your app but may affect its runtime behavior. Read the [guide at the bottom](#subtle-changes).
7. For production apps, you'll need to specify new signal, bootstrap, and ICE URLs.

## Update your package dependencies

### Rust

Update the `hdk` and `hdi` version strings in the project's root `Cargo.toml` file:

```diff:toml
 [workspace.dependencies]
-hdi = "=0.5.2"
-hdk = "=0.4.2"
+hdi = "=0.6.3" # Pick a later patch version of these libraries if you prefer.
+hdk = "=0.5.3"
+holochain_serialized_bytes = "*"
```

And update your zomes' `Cargo.toml` files as well:

```diff:toml
 [dependencies]
 hdk = { workspace = true }
 serde = { workspace = true }
+holochain_serialized_bytes = { workspace = true }
```

The latest version numbers of these libraries can be found on crates.io: [`hdi`](https://crates.io/crates/hdi), [`hdk`](https://crates.io/crates/hdk).

Once you've updated your `Cargo.toml` you need to update your `Cargo.lock` and check whether your project can still build. To do this in one step you can run:

```shell
cargo build
```

### (Optional) Update other Rust dependencies

Running a Cargo build, like suggested above, will update as few dependencies as it can. This is good for stability because it's just making the changes you asked for. However, sometimes you do need to update other dependencies to resolve build issues.

This section is marked as optional because it's possible that new dependencies could introduce new issues as well as fixing existing conflicts or problems. To make it possible to roll back this change, it might be a good idea to commit the changes you've made so far to source control. Then you can run:

```shell
cargo update
```

This will update your `Cargo.lock` with the latest versions of all libraries that the constraints in your `Cargo.toml` files will allow. Now you should try building your project again to see if that has resolved your issue.

### JavaScript

If you've created your hApp using our scaffolding tool, you should be able to follow these instructions. If you've created your own project folder layout, adapt these instructions to fit.

#### Tryorama tests

Edit your project's `tests/package.json` file:

```diff:json
   "dependencies": {
     // some dependencies
-    "@holochain/client": "^0.18.1",
-    "@holochain/tryorama": "^0.17.1",
+    "@holochain/client": "^0.19.1",
+    "@holochain/tryorama": "^0.18.2",
     // more dependencies
   },
```

#### UI

You'll update the UI package dependencies similarly to the test package. Edit `ui/package.json`:

```diff:json
   "dependencies": {
-    "@holochain/client": "^0.18.1",
+    "@holochain/client": "^0.19.1",
     // more dependencies
   },
```

Then in your project's root folder, run your package manager's update command to update the lockfile and install new package versions for your command-line tools, tests, and UI. Use the command that matches your chosen package manager. For example, if you're using `npm`:

```shell
npm install
```

## Update your application code

### Enums in the conductor APIs are serialized differently

The admin and app APIs have changed their serialization of enum variants with values: the variant name and value are now in `type` and `value` fields, and variant names have been normalized to snake_case. For instance, if you subscribe to signals in a JavaScript-based front end, you would change your signal handler like this:

```diff:typescript
 client.on("signal", (sig: Signal) => {
-    if (SignalType.App in sig) {
-        const signal = sig[SignalType.App];
+    if (sig.type == SignalType.App) {
+        const signal = sig.value;
         // ... Handle the app signal
     }
 });
```

This change happens in many places; we recommend that you run the TypeScript compiler against your UI and tests and look for errors. In the Holonix dev shell, run:

```bash
npx tsc -p ui/tsconfig.json
```
```bash
npx tsc -p tests/tsconfig.json
```

and look for messages that look similar to `error TS2322: Type X is not assignable to type Y`.

This won't catch all errors; you may discover some at runtime. Look for usage of the following types and functions in particular:

* [`CapAccess`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.capaccess.md) and [`GrantedFunctions`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.grantedfunctions.md) in a capability grant
* [`CellInfo`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.cellinfo.md)
* [`AdminWebsocket.installApp`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.adminwebsocket.installapp.md), where the [bundle source](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.appbundlesource.md) is an enum
* [`AppWebsocket.appInfo`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.appwebsocket.appinfo.md), whose [return type](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.appinfo.md) has many enums nested in it
* [`AppWebsocket.disableCloneCell`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.appwebsocket.disableclonecell.md) and [`AppWebsocket.enableCloneCell`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.appwebsocket.enableclonecell.md), which now take a new [`CloneCellId`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.clonecellid.md) type for their `clone_id` argument
* [`Signal`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.signal.md)

### `HoloHash` constructors renamed

`HoloHash<T>::from_raw_39` is now called [`HoloHash<T>::try_from_raw_39`](https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.5.2/holo_hash/struct.HoloHash.html#method.try_from_raw_39), and `HoloHash<T>::from_raw_39_panicky` is now [`HoloHash<T>::from_raw_39`](https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.5.2/holo_hash/struct.HoloHash.html#method.from_raw_39). Remember to check your code for usage of all the aliases of `HoloHash` -- `ActionHash`, `AgentPubKey`, `AnyDhtHash`, `AnyLinkableHash`, `DnaHash`, `EntryHash`, and `ExternalHash`.

Because the new name of the function that panics is the same as the old name of the function that returns a `Result`, you may need to do a search-and-replace in two stages.

### `AppWebsocket::callZome` can no longer accept a `null` cap secret

The `cap_secret` field in the `request` argument of [`AppWebsocket::callZome`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/v0.19.0/docs/client.appwebsocket.callzome.md) can no longer be `null` --- instead it must either be omitted (you don't need it at all if your UI is hosted by an [officially supported Holochain runtime](/get-started/4-packaging-and-distribution/)) or explicitly given.

```diff:typescript
 const results = await client.value.callZome({
     role_name: "my_dna",
     zome_name: "my_zome",
     fn_name: "foo",
     payload: null,
-    cap_secret: null,
 });
```

### `origin_time` and `quantum_time` are removed

With the new kitsune2 wire protocol, `origin_time` and `quantum_time` are no longer used. You may find these optional fields anywhere [integrity modifiers](/build/dnas/) are used:

* In `dna.yaml` manifests, the scaffolding tool in its previous version will have automatically add an `origin_time` field. Remove it, and check for any use of the `quantum_time` field too:

    ```diff:yaml
     manifest_version: '1'
     name: movies
     integrity:
       network_seed: null
       properties:
         foo: bar
         baz: 123
    -  origin_time: 1735841273312901
    -  quantum_time: 1000000
     # ...
    ```
* You can no longer pass these fields as DNA modifiers when you a install a hApp via the admin API or clone a cell via the app API. For example:

    ```diff:typescript
     let clonedCell = await client.createCloneCell({
         modifiers: {
             network_seed: "my_network_seed",
    -        origin_time: 1735841273312901,
    -        quantum_time: 1000000
         },
         name,
         role_name: "chat",
     });
    ```

### `AgentInfo::agent_latest_pubkey` behind feature flag

When you call [`agent_info`](https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/info/fn.agent_info.html) from a coordinator zome, the `agent_latest_pubkey` field in the [return value](https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/prelude/struct.AgentInfo.html) is now hidden behind the `unstable-dpki` feature flag and scheduled to be [removed in 0.6](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/4901). Anywhere you use this field, use `agent_initial_pubkey` instead:

```diff:rust
 use hdk::prelude::*;

 fn get_my_agent_id() -> ExternResult<AgentPubKey> {
-    Ok(agent_info()?.agent_latest_pubkey)
+    Ok(agent_info()?.agent_initial_pubkey)
 }
```

### DNA lineage behind feature flag

Features related to DNA lineage are now hidden behind an `unstable-migration` feature flag. If you don't plan to use this, remove the `lineage` line from your `dna.yaml` file:

```diff:yaml
 # ...
-lineage:
-  - "hC0kKUej3Mcu+40AjNGcaID2sQA6uAUcc9hmJV9XIdwUJUE" # cspell:disable-line
-  - "hCAkhy0q54imKYjEpFdLTncbqAaCEGK3LCE+7HIA0kGIvTw" # cspell:disable-line
 # ...
```

The `GetCompatibleCells` endpoint in the admin API is also hidden behind this flag.

If you want to use these features, [build a custom Holochain binary](https://github.com/holochain/holonix?tab=readme-ov-file#customized-holochain-build) with `unstable-migration` enabled. Note that [support for the endpoint has been removed from the JavaScript client](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/dee5a659503fe3816c1a57524a468c8d303602c6/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L18-L20).

### `AppBundleSource::Bundle` removed

**Note: This information is only relevant if you're building a runtime or using Tryorama's [`Conductor.prototype.installApp`](https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/v0.18.1/docs/tryorama.conductor.installapp.md) method, either directly or through a helper like `scenario.addPlayersWithApps`.** The `Bundle` option (deprecated in 0.4.2) is now removed from [`AppBundleSource`](https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.5.2/holochain_types/app/enum.AppBundleSource.html). If you need to pass bundle bytes to the admin API's `InstallApp` endpoint, use [`AppBundleSource::Bytes`](https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.5.2/holochain_types/app/enum.AppBundleSource.html#variant.Bytes) (introduced in 0.4.2) and pass the bytes of an entire hApp bundle file instead.

Note that, as a conductor API endpoint, `InstallApp` is also affected by [the enum serialization change](#enums-in-the-conductor-ap-is-are-serialized-differently):

```diff:typescript
-const playerConfig = { appBundleSource: { path: "./workdir/my_app.happ", } };
+const playerConfig: AppWithOptions = { appBundleSource: { type: "path", value: "./workdir/my_app.happ", } };
 const [alice, bob] = await scenario.addPlayersWithApps([playerConfig, playerConfig]);
```

### `scenario.addPlayerWithApp` input now more closely matches `addPlayersWithApps`

The signature of the [`Scenario.prototype.addPlayerWithApp`](https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/docs/tryorama.scenario.addplayerwithapp.md) method now takes an [`AppWithOptions`](https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/main/docs/tryorama.appwithoptions.md) object in the same way that `addPlayersWithApps` takes an array of the same object.

```diff:typescript
-const appBundleSource: AppBundleSource = { path: "./workdir/my_app.happ" };
+const appBundleSource: AppBundleSource = { type: "path", value: "./workdir/my_app.happ", };
 const options: AppOptions = { networkSeed: "special_network_seed", };
+const playerConfig: AppWithOptions = { appBundleSource, options, };
-const alice = scenario.addPlayerWithApp(appBundleSource, options);
+const alice = scenario.addPlayerWithApp(playerConfig);
```

### `hc run-local-services` replaced with `kitsune2-bootstrap-srv`

The old bootstrap and signal server have been combined into one binary called `kitsune2-bootstrap-srv`, which is provided in the Holonix dev environment for any new scaffolded hApps. To update an existing hApp, [edit its `flake.nix` file to include the binary](#update-nix-flake) and optionally [update its `package.json` file to use it](#update-package-json) if you use the Tauri-based launcher. Locally running hApp instances using `hc-spin` and `hc-launch` will now use the new binary.

### `disableCloneCell`, `enableCloneCell`, and `deleteCloneCell` signatures changed

The object that you pass to the JS client's [`AppWebsocket.prototype.disableCloneCell`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main-0.4/docs/client.appwebsocket.disableclonecell.md), [`AppWebsocket.prototype.enableCloneCell`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main-0.4/docs/client.appwebsocket.enableclonecell.md), and [`AdminWebsocket.prototype.deleteCloneCell`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.adminwebsocket.deleteclonecell.md) methods has changed; now you need to explicitly specify whether the identifier is a clone ID or DNA hash using the [new enum serialization format](#enums-in-the-conductor-ap-is-are-serialized-differently).

```diff:typescript
 let cellClonedByRoleName = client.createCloneCell({
-    clone_cell_id: "chat.1"
+    clone_cell_id: {
+        type: "clone_id",
+        value: "chat.1"
+   }
 });
 let dnaHash = decodeHashFromBase64("hC0kKUej3Mcu+40AjNGcaID2sQA6uAUcc9hmJV9XIdwUJUE"); // cspell:disable-line
 let cellClonedByDnaHash = client.createCloneCell({
-    clone_cell_id: dnaHash
+    clone_cell_id: {
+        type: "dna_hash",
+        value: dnaHash
+    }
 });
```

### Timestamps moved to `holochain_timestamp`

The `Timestamp` type used all over the HDK and in scaffolded entry types has been moved to a new crate called [`holochain_timestamp`](https://docs.rs/holochain_timestamp/latest/holochain_timestamp/index.html). This type has historically been made available transitively through `hdi::prelude` and `hdk::prelude`, so you shouldn't need to make any code changes unless you reference the `kitsune_p2p_timestamp` crate explicitly in any of your `Cargo.toml` files or code:

```diff:toml
 # ...
 [dependencies]
-kitsune_p2p_timestamp = "0.4.2"
+holochain_timestamp = "0.5.3"
```

```diff:rust
-use kitsune_p2p_timestamp::Timestamp;
+use holochain_timestamp::Timestamp;

 fn get_time() -> ExternResult<Timestamp> {
     sys_time()
 }
```

### App API's `NetworkInfo` removed

The `NetworkInfo` endpoint of the app API has been removed, which means the `AppWebsocket.networkInfo` method has also been removed. You can get some network info from the `DumpNetworkMetrics` and `DumpNetworkStats` endpoints, which are [now exposed on the app API](#dump-network-on-app-api).

### Networking section of conductor config changed

**Note: This only applies if you're using persistent conductor configs.** The `network` section of `conductor-config.yaml` files has changed. We recommend that you generate a new conductor config using `hc sandbox`, then compare it against your existing conductor config to see what changes need to be made. You can find available config keys in the [`NetworkConfig` documentation](https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.5.2/holochain_conductor_api/config/conductor/struct.NetworkConfig.html).

### Admin API's `AgentInfo` return value changed

**Note: This is an advanced feature that you'll only encounter if you're building a custom runtime that tries to get diagnostic data.** The return value of the [`AgentInfo`](https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.AgentInfo) endpoint in the admin API has changed. Currently it outputs a vector of JSON-serialized [`kitsune2_api::AgentInfoSigned`](https://docs.rs/kitsune2_api/latest/kitsune2_api/struct.AgentInfoSigned.html) values.

## Production apps: new network infrastructure servers

With the change to Kitsune2, the public bootstrap and signal server API has changed. Holo is not hosting public servers like they are for Holochain 0.4. For testing, we're offering public servers you can use. **We request and recommend that you maintain your own bootstrap and signal servers for production hApps**<!-- TODO: document this https://github.com/holochain/docs-pages/issues/573 -->, as the test servers are rate-limited and have no uptime guarantees. You can find the server binary on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/kitsune2_bootstrap_srv) or adapt [this example `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/blob/main/docker/kitsune2_bootstrap_srv/Dockerfile) (see [this example](https://github.com/holochain/network-services/blob/main/dev-test/docker-compose.yaml#L5-L12) for TLS configuration).

If you're bundling your hApp with [Kangaroo](https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron), you'll need to add these servers to your `kangaroo.config.ts` file. The following example shows URLs for the dev test servers and public STUN/ICE servers from Google and Cloudflare, along with new hashes and version numbers for the bundled binaries.

```diff:typescript
 import { defineConfig } from './src/main/defineConfig';

 export default defineConfig({
   appId: 'org.holochain.kangaroo-electron',
   productName: 'Holochain Kangaroo Electron',
   version: '0.1.0',
   macOSCodeSigning: false,
   windowsEVCodeSigning: false,
   fallbackToIndexHtml: true,
   autoUpdates: true,
   systray: true,
   passwordMode: 'password-optional',
+  // For production hApps, swap the following URLs for your own self-hosted
+  // URLs.
+  bootstrapUrl: 'https://dev-test-bootstrap2.holochain.org/',
+  signalUrl: 'wss://dev-test-bootstrap2.holochain.org/',
+  // You may want to replace these free public STUN server URLs with ones
+  // from your preferred WebRTC provider.
+  iceUrls: ['stun:stun.l.google.com:19302','stun:stun.cloudflare.com:3478'],
     bins: {
     holochain: {
-      version: '0.4.1',

!!! info Upgrading your Kangaroo-based project
To get your Kangaroo-based hApp working with Holochain 0.5, you'll also need to compare your project's code against the code in the `kangaroo-electron` template repo for Holochain 0.5 (currently at [this commit](https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron/commit/7d3208a3161bebb51f6114233dd7386b0815b79d)<!-- TODO(upgrade): change this commit as needed -->), make changes as needed, and follow the guidance above for updating UI and zome code.
!!!

## Subtle changes

The following changes don't break Holochain's APIs or require updates to your code, but they may require you to reassess whether your hApp will work as expected:

* Your front end can now call the `init` callback in any cell as if it were a regular zome function. This will in turn trigger the init process, which runs all coordinator zomes' `init` functions in the order the zomes appear in the DNA manifest. If it succeeds, the `init` callback in the zome you targeted _won't_ be erroneously run a second time in this call or any subsequent calls.
* The admin API's [`DumpNetworkMetrics`](https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DumpNetworkMetrics) and [`DumpNetworkStats`](https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DumpNetworkStats) are now available on the app API as well, which means that a UI written for any web-based launcher can now access them via the JavaScript client's [`AppWebsocket.prototype.dumpNetworkMetrics`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.appwebsocket.dumpnetworkmetrics.md) and [`AppWebsocket.prototype.dumpNetworkStats`](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.appwebsocket.dumpnetworkStats.md) methods. Additionally, `DumpNetworkMetrics` now has an option to include a DHT summary. The output of these endpoints has changed as a result of the new network layer. {#dump-network-on-app-api}
