# Who is Holochain For?

### Holochain is a smart choice if:

* Your application needs to be accessible despite unreliable network conditions or total loss of connectivity.
* You want adaptive security that minimizes the impact of data breaches and automatically responds to attacks.
* You want to see your application scale automatically and cheaply with user adoption.
* You want to meet strong privacy requirements (e.g., [GDPR](https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/beyond-gdpr-holo-vault-delivering-on-self-sovereign-identity-for-distributed-applications-543a5449d5c9) and [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#Privacy_Rule)) without much hassle.
* You want to respect the privacy and agency of your users.
* You want to equip your user communities to own their infrastructure—without having to become system admins.
* You’re exploring more ethical business models and want technology that makes it affordable to embody your values.
* You’re ready to trade some control for technology that puts your users first.
* You’ve tried blockchain, but found it slow, expensive, and hard to tweak for your governance and permissioning needs.
